## Constants Over Magic Numbers
- Replace hard-coded values with named constants.
- Use descriptive constant names that explain the value's purpose.
- Keep constants at the top of the file or in a dedicated constants file.

## Meaningful Names
- Variables, functions, and classes should reveal their purpose.
- Names should explain why something exists and how it's used.
- Avoid abbreviations unless they're universally understood.

## Smart Comments
- Don't comment on what the code does — make the code self-documenting.
- Use comments to explain *why* something is done a certain way, not *what* is done.
- Document APIs, complex algorithms, and non-obvious side effects.

## Single Responsibility
- Each function should do exactly one thing.
- Functions should be small and focused.
- If a function needs a comment to explain what it does, it should be split.

## DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Extract repeated code into reusable functions.
- Share common logic through proper abstraction.
- Maintain single sources of truth.

## Clean Structure
- Keep related code together.
- Organize code in a logical hierarchy.
- Use consistent file and folder naming conventions.

## Encapsulation
- Hide implementation details.
- Expose clear interfaces.
- Move nested conditionals into well-named functions.

## Code Quality Maintenance
- Refactor continuously.
- Fix technical debt early, before it accumulates.
- **Follow the Boy Scout Principle: always leave the code cleaner than you found it.**
- Treat small improvements as part of daily work, not as separate refactoring phases.

## Testing
- Write tests before fixing bugs.
- Keep tests readable and maintainable.
- Test edge cases and error conditions.
